    <p>How hard could it be to write and host a website without breaking the bank?</p>
    <p>Well, let's just say that it isn't as easy as you may expect...</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>First thing first, let me explain why putting all the effort behind making a website in the first place: I had some free time and a spare Raspberry Pi Zero W laying around on my desk (which I was using as a <a href="https://pwnagotchi.ai/">pwnagotchi</a>) and I thought to myself that I could get much more use out of that sweet ARM chip.</p><a href='https://postimg.cc/6TffKg8y' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/PfB3Wkhz/Whats-App-Image-2023-11-26-at-00-49-52.jpg' border='0' alt='Whats-App-Image-2023-11-26-at-00-49-52'/></a><figcaption>The last picture of my beloved wtx</figcaption><p>Little did I know that using a six years old chip would cause me so many problems.</p>

<h2>Registering a free domain</h2>
      <p>The first step to my website was to register a domain on the web -a text based lable with the only advantage of being easier to memorize than the website IP- possibly with my name on it. The first service that came to mind was "<i>Ngrok</i>": a service that allows developers to expose local servers to the web by tunneling the connection from the localhost to a randomically generated domain.</p>
